# React Surreal Estate

It is a React property search engine that will have multiple pages:

* A listings page where you can search for different properties and sort/filter the results.

* An add property page where you will add new properties.

## Concepts to be used
* Single Page Application (SPA)

* Client-side Routing

* Controlled Inputs

* HTTP Requests

* API Interaction

* OAuth

## Database 
For this project, Manchester Codes created an API for the course. It is an CRUD REST API which interacts with a MongoDB database. The API was deployed by myself to be able to use it publicly on Heroku.
